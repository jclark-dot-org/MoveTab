MoveTab
=======

A chrome extension that helps you move your tabs from one window to another. 

Ever tried moving a chrome tab to another window while its minimised or on another desktop, all the while having to drag it and find the right focus on the right window? Annoying isn't it? 

MoveTab solves that problem by helping you move tabs in two steps. 
1. Go to the tab you want to move and click on MoveTab. 
2. Go to the window where you want it and click on MoveTab again.

It's that simple!
